# The Vision Set camera plugs into the robot's USB port and streams through the
# robot: about 9 new pictures per second as JPEG (measured 24.10.26; the 16 of the first day was nominal).
# Plugged into the laptop instead it is a plain USB
# camera at 32 frames per second (OpenCV index 1; index 0 is the laptop's own webcam).
# Camera: in its original bracket, screwed on (25.10.26). The bracket sits on the wrist link: joint 6
# does not move the camera (four pictures with only joint 6 turned are identical), and the view stayed
# the same over the whole 24 cm push while the forearm tilted about 40 degrees, so the camera follows
# the rod's lean (joint 5), not the forearm. Confirmed on 26.10.26 from Niryo's own set-up guide: the holder
# screws into the wrist's aluminium brace beside the joint-6 motor. Niryo's calibration file gives a 64
# degree lens (fx 508 px). With the magnet block on the rod the wrist sits 2.6 cm higher, and
# from there the puck stays at the bottom of every picture over the whole line (scripted push).
# Reference picture 03_data/raw/camera_check/view_reference_rod_camera_start_pose.jpg. Do not touch
# the camera or its focus ring. Calibration: only the automatic one after a restart, never manual.

# (03_data/raw/workspace/push_straight/): the 1 cm line is 75 px wide beside the puck and 63 px wide at
# the top of the 640 px picture, and the paper's far edge enters the top of the picture when the puck is
# about 7 cm short of it. The window always points straight away from the base, because a vertical rod
# forces the forearm roll (joint 4) to zero, so the line ahead stays in view only while the path heads
# within about 45 degrees of that direction; the puck itself stays in view up to about 60 degrees. When
# pushing straight the line sits about a third of the way in from one side (column 150 to 200).

# them per second are new pictures, so the camera's real rate is 9 per second in this light, not the
# 16 seen before. Tip shifts land within 0.5 mm and the arm returns home within 0.7 mm. A

# tried, so the control loop gets one decision every one to two seconds at the 20 % cap. Only one
# program can hold the robot: a second connection hangs at connect and never answers, while the
